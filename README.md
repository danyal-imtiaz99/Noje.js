# Noje.js
Noje.JS Web Server 


Developed a robust Node.js server application handling HTTP requests and responses efficiently. 
Implemented request handlers for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods using req.method and req.url. 
Managed data streams with req object events and buffering. Set HTTP status codes, headers, and response body using res.statusCode, res.setHeader, res.write, and res.end. Incorporated error handling, logging user requests to specific pages in a log file, and integrated express/restify modules for middleware support.
